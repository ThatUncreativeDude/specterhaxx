## Why are you releasing this?
A long time ago, I made a script for a game called Specter 2 called Specterhaxx which was a project me and my friend made in a few days because he wanted to get into learning Lua so I thought a good way to teach him was making a script for some dogshit Phasmophobia copy with no anti-cheat so we proceeded to reverse-engineer the game and look at ModuleScripts & LocalScripts to make some features and we were done.

But unfortunately, that friend isn't interested in Lua anymore and the project has been discontinued now that there are actually good cheats for the game now, I would like to release the source code of specterhaxx for people to learn from. So, here you go :

## Won't the game developers just patch this?
Don't really care. I wouldn't recommend basing or using this as a cheat for the game anymore as all of these features could be detected pretty easily or the game developers could change up how the game works with some minor changes and break the entire script. Honestly, if you get banned or the script has any issues, blame yourself for relying on a script from 07-12-2022

## Can I take code from this project?
Go ahead, feel free to take a look at this source code and use this for your project but be aware that this hasn't been updated since 07-12-2022 (except for some minor bug fixes after a few days of release) so don't be surprised if anything is detected or it's broken.
